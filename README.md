# Text editor

WIP

## Requirements
- SDL3
- SDL3_ttf
- JetBrainsMono-regular True Type Font file -> src/fonts
or some any other monospaced font

## Building
- Using the build.sh script, which uses cmake and make to build the project
```
cd path/to/repo
.\build.sh
```

- Probably gonna add a visual studio solution file later (maybe)
- Tested on Linux, I guess it should work on Windows too
